      AdPress is hands down the best Ads Management plug-in for WordPress. AdPress is easy to setup and use; and is fully automated. AdPress allows customization of both Image and Link Ads, Selling Ad spots on your website, handling the payment and contract of these sales. AdPress also provides detailed statics and analytics about the Ad performance.
      </p>
      <p>
      AdPress is a premium WordPress plug-in. You need to purchase a license to be able to use it. There are two types of licenses offered (regular and extended). Read more about <a href="http://codecanyon.net/wiki/support/legal-terms/licensing-terms/">licensing terms</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Support is offered through email and a self-managed forum. We encourage you to use the forum whenever possible so that solutions are shared with the other members of the community.
      </p>
		</div>
		<div class="section level_1" name="How AdPress Works">
<p>
AdPress is different than other Ad Management plug-ins. Below is a detailed explanation of how it works. Please read this section fully, as it is primordial to understand how the plug-in works.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Designing the Ads</h3>

<p>
The step 1 is to design your Ads. AdPress supports two Ad types: Image and Link. When designing your Ads, you sepecify the following
</p>

<ul>
<li>The image size, and column numbers (or the maximum number of characters for link ads)</li>
<li>The number of Ads</li>
<li>How you are going to sell your Ads: Duration, pageviews or clicks.</li>
<li>The Price</li>
<li>Where your Ads will be located (sidebar, footer, blog post...)</li>
<li>Customizing your Ads look (with CSS and JavaScript)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This step is fully documented in Part 3: Designing your Ads. After you have designed an 'Ad Placement', you can now start selling it through your website.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Selling your Ads</h3>

<p>
After designing your Ads, you can start selling the Ads placement on your Website. If you are using PayPal to accept payments, the payment process is fully automated for you. If you are not using PayPal, you can let the buyers put a message when purchasing the Ad with the transaction ID or the Payment processor of your choice.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Managing clients: How to limit and grant access for users to purchase Ads</li>
<li>Approving your Ads</li>
<li>Monitoring your running Ads statistics</li>
<li>Reviewing your purchase history</li>
</ul>

<p>This step is fully documented in Part 4: Selling Ads.</p>

<h3>No Clients? No Problem.</h3>

<p>
If you have no clients (purchasers), and you are willing to manage Ads yourself, AdPress is still for you. Read Part 4.x to know how AdPress can work for you.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section level_1" name="Designing Ads">
			<div class="section level_2" name="Create a Campaign">
<p>
The first step to design your Ads is by creating a campaign. A campaign is defined by three parts
</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Campaign Information</strong> The campaign name and description. These information will be presented to the buyers, so try to put something descriptive.</li>
<li><strong>Ad Design</strong> Ad Type (Image/Link) and Settings (Size, number, columns...).</li>
<li><strong>Contract Type</strong> Select if you are selling by duration, page views or clicks and also the price.</li>
</ol>

That's it. Now this campaign already defines a lot about your Ad. The next steps are going to be where you'll put your Ad into your template and how to customize its' look with CSS and also JavaScript.
			</div>
			<div class="section level_2" name="Integrate Ads">
        <p>
        There are 3 ways to integrate AdPress Ads inside your templates
        </p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Widgets</strong> That's probably the easiest way to do it. There is a ready-made AdPress Widget. Just drag and drop the widget to the sidebar of your choice, change the title and select the campaign you want to run.</li>
        <li><strong>ShortCodes</strong> Another easy option. However, shortcodes are only useful inside a blog post or a page. Most of the time, this won't be the case, as you'll be looking for something that displays in every page or blog post without having to enter it every time.</li>
        <li><strong>PHP Code</strong> This involves editing your Theme templates. It's relatively easy and straightforward if you have some experience with HTML and PHP.</li>
        </ol>
				<div class="section level_3" name="Widget Integration">
          <p>
            To insert AdPress Ads as a widget, your template must have widget-ready sidebars. Generally, templates has a right sidebar which you can customize from the WordPress Appearance menu. Premium templates might have footer and header sidebar. You can add the AdPress widget more than one time. You can customize the widget title, and the select the campaign to display.
          </p>
          <img src="files/img/widget.png" />
				</div>

				<div class="section level_3" name="ShortCodes Integration">
          <p>
            If you play to insert the Ad inside a blog post or page text, shortcodes are the way to go. It's very rare, though. You'll need to enter the code for every blog post you publish. It's also quite simple, use the following code to insert your shortcode.
          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
[adpress campaign=5]
</pre>
          <p>
            Each campaign has a unique ID. In the AdPress campaigns page you can find the associated ID for each campaign.
          </p>
				</div>
				<div class="section level_3" name="Template Integration">
          <p>
            Template integration is probably the best (since you can specify the exact place of the Ads), but requires HTML/CSS and also some PHP knowledge.
          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?php
if (function_exists(display_campaign)) {
	display_campaign(1);
}
?&g t;
</pre>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section level_2" name="Customize Ads Appearence">
<p>
Customizing Ad appearance is possible with AdPress. For both Image and Link Ads, AdPress generate an HTML list (UL) where Ads are HTML items (LI).
This is a sample of the default generated code for an Image Ad Campaign
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ul class="image-campaign"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://adurl.com" target="_blank"&gt;
      &lt;img src="http://siteurl.com/img1.png"/&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://anotherad.com" target="_blank"&gt;
      &lt;img src="http://siteurl.com/img2.png"/&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<p>
With AdPress, it's possible to change the generated code for the HTML items. This generated code can be found used Settings->Image Ad for image Ads and Settings->Link Ad for link Ads.
</p>
        <div class="section level_3" name="Changing the HTML">
          <p>
            The HTML for Image and link Ad can be found in the Settings->Image Ad (tab) page, and Settings->Link Ad (tab) page. The following is the default code for both of them. The HTML code is mixed with AdPress variables. These variables will be replaced when AdPress generates the Ads Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Default code for the Image Ad</strong>
          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;a href="@url" target="_blank"&gt;
		&lt;img src="@image_src"/&gt;
	&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</pre>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>url</strong> The target Ad URL</li>
            <li><strong>image_src</strong> The Ad image src URL</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Default code for the Flash Ad</strong>
          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;div style="height: @banner_height; width: @banner_width; position: relative;"&gt;
		&lt;a target="_blank" style="height: @banner_height; width: @banner_width;" href="@url"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;embed style="position: absolute;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="@swf_src" quality="high" 
                wmode="transparent" height="@banner_height" width="@banner_width"&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</pre>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>url</strong> The target Ad URL</li>
            <li><strong>swf_src</strong> The Flash banner src</li>
            <li><strong>banner_height</strong> The banner height (px)</li>
            <li><strong>banner_width</strong> The banner width (px)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Default code for the Link Ad</strong>
          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;a href="@url" target="_blank"&gt;@link_text&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</pre>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>url</strong> The target Ad URL</li>
          <li><strong>link_text</strong> The text of the link Ad</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
				<div class="section level_3" name="Styling items with CSS">
          <p>
            Beyond changing the HTML code, you can also edit and add styling to the generated HTML code. AdPress comes with a default, simple and minimalistic CSS styling
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>CSS Code for the Image Ad</strong>
          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
.image-campaign
{
	list-style: none;
}
.image-campaign li
{
	display: list-item;
	float: left;
	padding: 0;
	margin: 5px;
}
</pre>
          <p>
            <strong>CSS Code for the Flash Ad</strong>
          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

}

.link-campaign li
{
	color: #777;
	font-size: 15px;
}
</pre>
				</div>
				<div class="section level_3" name="Adding JavaScript Effects">
          <p>
            It's possible to add JavaScript effects to the generated Ads code. AdPress has no special support for this, so you need to add the code yourself. AdPress Ads lists has a class. (image-campaign for Image Ads, and link-campaign for Link Ads).
          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
;
(function($) {
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('.image-campaign li').hover(function() {
      $(this).animate({
        'opacity':1
      });
    }, function() {
      $(this).animate({
        'opacity':0.5
      });
    });
  });
})(jQuery);
</pre>
				</div>
			<div class="section level_2" name="CTA Ads">
        <p>
          It's cool to have all your Ad Spots all the time, however, in the real world this happens very little. This is why we have made a CTA Ad feature. CTA for Call To Action. This new feature implemented in version 2.0 will help sell your vacant spots.
        </p>
        <img src="files/img/ad_cta.png" />
        <h3>How it works?</h3>
        <p>
          When there is an available spot in your campaign, AdPress will display your CTA Ad. This is typically, an empty image with a text of "Advertise here" for Image Ads, or an "Advertise Here" link for Link Ads. The target URL of this Ad is a link your specify. It should be a landing page that explains to the user and gives him more information about advertising on your website.
        <br>
          The CTA Ad only appears when there is one or more few spots. Only one CTA Ad will be displayed.
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          Click the Ad CTA Checkbox to enable this feature. If you are using an Image Ad, you'll need to upload an image, and enter the target URL. If you are using a Link Ad, you'll need to enter the Ad text and also the target URL.
        </p>
      </div>

		<div class="section level_1" name="Selling Ads">
			<div class="section level_2" name="Managing Clients">
        <p>
          After designing your Ads, it's time to start selling. AdPress offers a dashboard where buyers can see the available campaigns and order Ads. This dashboard is only accessible for registered users with the right permission.
        </p>

        <h3>Get your clients to register</h3>

        <p>
          Your clients must register so they can buy Ads. Make sure you enable registration in WordPress, so they can sign up. After signing up as a user, they get assigned a role. By default, this role is "Subscriber", but you can change that.
        </p>

        <img src="files/img/enable_registration.png" />

        <p>
          In AdPress Settings Panel, set the users role to allow access the AdPress Client Dashboard. Set it to "All" if you want all users regardless of their roles to access the Client Dashboard. Set it to "Administrator" if you want to disable the Dashboard for all users.
        </p>

        <img src="files/img/set_role.png" />

        <p>
          Once clients have registered and logged in to their WordPress dashbaord, and you have granted them the right to access AdPress Client Dashboard, they can buy Ads.
        </p>

        <img src="files/img/client_dashboard.png" />
			</div>
      <div class="section level_2" name="Purchasing Ads">3
        <p>
          Once registered and granted access, clients can see the running campaigns and available ads. They can also order Ads.
        </p>
        <img src="files/img/purchase_ad_thumb.png" class="enlarge" />
        <p>
          To order an Ad, the client has to enter the required information. The client can also leave a message (if you allow it). This is optional. The message will be shown in the requests page.
        </p>
        <img src="files/img/purchase_ad_2_thumb.png" class="enlarge" />
      </div>
			<div class="section level_2" name="Ads Requests">
        <p>
          Ads don't go live when clients order them. They are queued in the review queue. You can approve or reject them. The AdPress bar notifies you when there are new pending Ads. Once in the Ads requests page, click the more button to get more information about the Ad as well as the payment details (if PayPal is enabled).
        </p>
        <img src="files/img/ads_requests_thumb.png" class="enlarge" />
			</div>
			<div class="section level_2" name="Running Ads">
        <p>
          Once Ads are approved, they are listed in the Running Ads List. It's worth mentioning that only clients that purchased the Ads can stop running Ads. You can only check the Stats for the Ad, and also how much credit (clicks, views or days) until the Ad expires.
        </p>
        <img src="files/img/running_ads_thumb.png" class="enlarge" />
        <p>
          Clicking the Stats button will take you to the stats page. You can visualize the Ad stats from this page in a graph and also in a table detailing all the click, views and CTR.
        </p>
        <img src="files/img/ad_stats_thumb.png" class="enlarge"/>
        <p>
          <strong>P.S</strong> It's still possible to disable a client Ad, by gaining control of the client account (from your WordPress Admin panel) and disabling the Ad from his control panel
        </p>
			</div>
			<div class="section level_2" name="PayPal Integration">
        <p>
          To automate payments, AdPress has PayPal support. AdPress uses the PayPal ExpressCheckout process. Read more about <a href="https://merchant.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=merchant/express_checkout">PayPal Expresscheckout</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="files/img/paypal_settings.png" />
        <p>
          <strong>SandBox Mode</strong> If you are new to PayPal Express Checkout, please sign up for their <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">Sandbox test suite</a> and get used to how PayPal works. PayPal has got a sandbox mode, which is a virtual platform similar to the one running PayPal. Its purpose is to make tests and see how it works before trying in real life. By checking this box, you enable the Sandbox mode.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Refunds</strong> AdPress supports refunds. When a purchaser make a purchase and it gets rejected (or cancels it before running), it makes sense to refund the payment. If refunds are enabled, rejecting the Ad will automatically issue the refund.
        </p>
			</div>
			<div class="section level_2" name="Purchase History">
        <p>
          Every purchase is recorded by AdPress. The history is available from the Settings->history (tab). The history displays the time, date and details of the purchase. For the first version, it's not possible to see Ad Stats. This feature is planned in the future.
        </p>
        <img src="files/img/purchase_history_thumb.png" class="enlarge" />

		</div>
    <div class="section level_1" name="Import/Export">
      <p>
        AdPress has a powerful import and export feature. This feature will help you move your plug-in settings and data from a WordPress install to another with ease. The Import/Export panel is available in the Settings page of the plug-in, under the "Import/Export" tab.
      </p>
      <img src="files/img/import_thumb.png" class="enlarge" />
      <div class="section level_2" name="How it works?">
      <p>
        AdPress has 3 types of data that you can export, import and reset: Plug-in Settings, Campaign Data, and History Data.
      </p>
        <div class="section level_3" name="Plug-in Settings">
          <p>
            Plug-in Settings include the settings that can be set in the General, Image Ad and Link Ad panel. AdPress has a default configuration for these settings, but you can change them. (like adding PayPal ExpressCheckout details).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level_3" name="Campaign Data">
          <p>
            Campaign Data include all the campaigns and their Ads (running, waiting or available). There can't be a separation between campaigns and their Ads, they are linked together.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level_3" name="History Data">
          <p>
            The History data can be found in the Settings panel, under the History tab. The history data is separate from the campaigns data.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section level_2" name="Exporting settings">
        <p>
          First select one or more types of data (Plug-in Settings, Campaign Data or History Data) and then click the Export Button. The page will reload, and a new box will appear at the top with a download link. Click the link to download the back-up file. This file has the data that you asked for. The data is encoded so opening the file with a notepad will not help much understand its content. It can be read only with AdPress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure you store the file in a secure location.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section level_2" name="Importing settings">
        <p>
          Before importing any settings, you should have a back-up file. This back-up file must have the data you are looking to import. For example, if you want to import "History Data", the back-up file must have history data too.
        <br>
        Select the types of data to import, and then select the back-up file and click the import button.
        </p>
        <h3>Important notice</h3>
        <p>
          AdPress doesn't do a data merge. The import feature will completely replace your old settings. If you have campaign data, they'll be removed before the import process. This is rather a lack in our plug-in, and we are working on a merge feature in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section level_2" name="Plug-in Reset">
        <p>
          The plug-in reset will return the plug-in to a fresh install state. You can specify which types of data to reset, though.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section level_1" name="Product Support">
      <p>
        The plug-in comes with limited support. We try to support all cases, but we can only garantuee the following
      </p>
